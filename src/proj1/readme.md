In this basic project :
 - We connect to OpenAI using api key
 - Invoke the LLM using simple prompt and print its response to console.

This single file project helps in basic understanding of LLM calling from Python and tweaking some key parameters like Temperature, Model type, Max tokens

For running this code locally, 
 - create .env in your directory -> paste your Openai API key in .env file as below :
 OPENAI_API_KEY=your key here
